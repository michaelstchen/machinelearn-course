Language: Python2

Instructions:
I've named all of the submitted scripts with the part I use them
for (e.g. spam_simple.py is for my lone decision tree on spam data,
census_forest.py is for my forest for the census data). To run the
scripts in a UNIX shell please make sure python is installed
and call the scripts from the terminal as follows:

    python -i census_forest.py

The "-i" is used to stay in interactive mode to check values after the script completes (e.g. to check "err", which is the variable I use for my validation error rates)
