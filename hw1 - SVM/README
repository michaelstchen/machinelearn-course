Platform: Ubuntu
Language: Python 2
Libraries: numpy, scipy, sklearn, matplotlib, csv

Instructions:
	For each problem I have written a script (e.g. prob1.py). To reproduce my results run the following in the terminal with the according python file (e.g. switch 'prob1.py' with 'prob2.py' to run problem 2 stuff)

	'python prob1.py'

	Note that prob1.py, prob2.py, and prob3.py should be located in the 'digit-dataset' folder. prob4.py should be located in the 'spam-dataset' folder. Also note that all requred plots and figures, as well as the results of various benchmarks, are written to files during the running of the scripts with appropriately named filenames.

Credits:
	- I used the 'benchmark' function written by Kunal Marwaha
	  and posted on Piazza
	- The idea for using 'np.random.set_state(random_state)' to
	  specify the random generator seed was taken from
	  StackOverflow.
