\begin{enumerate}[a.]
  \item Mean-Squared Error
    \begin{itemize}
      \item All of the weights were initialized randomly, drawing from a normal distribution with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 0.01. A constant learning rate of 0.01 was used. Training was stopped after one epoch (50000 images drawn randomly with replacement).
      \item The training accuracy was 0.89872. The validation accuracy was 0.8814.
      \item The total training time was 839.56 seconds (14 minutes).
      \item Below is a plot of the batch MSE loss over the training period calculated for every 1000 samples trained on

  \item Cross-Entropy Error
    \begin{itemize}
      \item All of the weights were initialized randomly, drawing from a normal distribution with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 0.01. A constant learning rate of 0.01 was used. Training was stopped after one epoch (50000 images drawn randomly with replacement).
      \item The training accuracy was 0.9536. The validation accuracy was 0.9412.
      \item The total training time was 811.48 seconds (13.5 minutes).
      \item Below is a plot of the batch cross-entropy loss over the training period calculated for every 1000 samples trained on
